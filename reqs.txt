All imports should be in first cell of notebook
Only one function per cell
Preference is to use Polars library for dataframes and data manipulation
Preference is to use altair for charts and graphics
Any database that is created should be sqlite


API endpoint
https://data.police.uk/api/crimes-at-location?date=2024-01&lat=52.629729&lng=-1.131592

Limit to 10 API endpoint requests per second
Date should be in year-month format (example 2025-01)
lat is latitude
lng is longitude
All points should be expressed as latitude and longitude when calling the API

For each location (latitude longitude pair) that is queried, I am interested in capturing the Category, ID, location lat, location long, location street name, and the Month (date of the crime)).  This data should be captured to a sqlite database and new entries should be checked if they already exist by using the ID.

API endpoint should be called only when a Postcode is entered into a text input and submitted.  A date in the format of year-month should also be submitted with a default of last month (from today).  This can also be changed via an input field.

Resulting crimes at lcation should be projeted onto a map to show the location of each crime.  The map should be zoomed to a size of 2.5 miles by 2.5 miles.  Each crime category should be a different colour dot on the map at the lcation where the crime took place.
